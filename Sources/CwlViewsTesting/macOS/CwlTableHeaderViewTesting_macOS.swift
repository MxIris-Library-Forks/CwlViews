	// You can easily convert the `Binding` cases to `BindingParser` using the following Xcode-style regex:
	// Replace: case ([^\(]+)\((.+)\)$
	// With:    public static var $1: BindingParser<$2, TableHeaderView.Binding, Downcast> { return .init(extract: { if case .$1(let x) = \$0 { return x } else { return nil } }, upcast: { \$0.asTableHeaderViewBinding() }) }
		
	//	0. Static bindings are applied at construction and are subsequently immutable.
	
	// 1. Value bindings may be applied at construction and may subsequently change.

	// 2. Signal bindings are performed on the object after construction.

	// 3. Action bindings are triggered by the object after construction.

	// 4. Delegate bindings require synchronous evaluation within the object's context.
