	/// NOTE: the first step should be to call `inheritedPrepareInstance`. `BinderDelegate` should call `prepareDelegate`

	/// - Parameters:
	///   - binding: the binding to apply
	///   - instance: the instance
	///   - storage: the storage
	/// - Returns: If maintaining bindings requires ongoing lifetime management, these lifetimes are maintained by returning instances of `Lifetime`.
